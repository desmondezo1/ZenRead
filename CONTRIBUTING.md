## How to Report a Bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email [desmondezoojile@gmail.com](mailto:desmondezoojile@gmail.com) instead.

If you're reporting a non-critical issue, follow these steps:

- Use the GitHub issue search â€” check if the issue has already been reported.
- If the issue has not been reported, [open a new issue](https://github.com/desmondezo1/ZenRead/issues/new).
- Provide a clear title and description.
- Include as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## How to Suggest a Feature or Enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in ZenRead, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
